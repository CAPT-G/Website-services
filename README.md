# Website-Services

For a polished one-page site, responsive UI, animations, schema/SEO, gallery modal, reviews marquee, deployment + DNS **one-time** is **$1,500–$2,500**. Provided branding polish/copywriting/imagery sourcing, push to **$2,500–$3,500**.

Productized (I don’t negotiate from scratch), I offer **Good / Better / Best**:

### Good — Launch

**$1,200–$1,800** one-time

* Single page (hero, services, gallery, pricing, FAQ, contact)
* Mobile-first + accessibility pass
* Basic SEO (OG tags, JSON-LD, sitemap/robots)
* Deployment + DNS + analytics hookup

### Better — Local Growth

**$2,000–$3,000** one-time
Everything in Launch **+**

* City/Service-area section buildout (like your grid) or 3–5 subpages
* Performance tuning (Lighthouse 90+)
* Conversion tracking (calls/texts/CTA events)
* Google Business Profile optimization checklist

### Best — Lead Engine

**$3,500–$6,000** one-time
Everything in Local Growth **+**

* Booking form or SMS workflow + auto-responses
* Structured review widget wired to GBP
* Copy rewrites + light brand system (type/spacing/colors)
* A/B test ready (CTA variants)

### Care Plans (recurring)

* **Hosting & Care (essential): $49–$79/mo** — hosting (Vercel/Netlify), SSL, backups, uptime, security headers.
* **Growth (recommended): $149–$299/mo** — essential + monthly content/FAQ tweaks (1–2 hrs), analytics report, schema updates, image optimizations, GBP posts.
* **Local SEO add-on: $300–$800/mo** — citations, review prompts, rank tracking, content for 2–4 city pages/quarter.

### A la carte (when you don’t want plans)

* Small changes: **$120–$180/hr** (set a 1-hr minimum).
* Booking/Stripe integration: **$300–$1,200** (scope-dependent).
* Copywriting package: **$300–$1,200**.
* Logo touch-ups: **$150–$500**.

### How to justify the number (value framing)

* Position it as a **lead-gen asset**. If a detail is ~$200 and the site nets just **2–4 bookings/month**, it covers a $2–3k build in 3–6 months; ongoing care helps keep that pipeline full.
